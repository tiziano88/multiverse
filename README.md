# Multiverse

Mutiverse is a specification for a self-hosted knowledge base.

If you want to publish something on the internet, what options do you have? You could create a Facebook, X (Twitter) or Linkedin post, or have your own blog or website, or publish to something like Medium. But in all those cases, you are giving out the content to one of those websites, hoping that it will reach your followers there. But there is no notion of a unified identity across all those websites, that you can control.

With Multiverse, you own all the data you want to publish. For instance, you could publish an article, a recipe, a book review, an essay, a list of places to visit, a photo album, or anything else, in a structured way, on a host of your choice, in the Multiverse binary format.

Your followers then access your data via a client, either web based or as a mobile or native app. Anyone can create a client by rendering the data in the Multiverse schema, and users of such clients can additionally customize the presentation of the content. For instance, fonts, size, colors, appearance, accessibility and other features should be controlled by the consumer of the data, not the producer.

The data should be as structured as possible so that it is possible to preserve it indefinitely (including for future generations) by keeping it separate from the presentation layer, which may change over time (e.g. web, audio, VR, etc.).
